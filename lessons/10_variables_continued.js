// Let's talk more about defining variables
// There is a keyword called const that defines a constant
// in our code. A constant is a variable that, once it has been
// set, cannot be changed
// 
// Instead of using the keyword var, you would use the keyword const
// 
// Now let's try
//
// Define a constant variable called pi and set it to 3.14
// Your solution here
// 
// Try using console.log to print the variable pi
// Your solution here
