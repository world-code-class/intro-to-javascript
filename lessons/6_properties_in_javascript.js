// Properties in Javascript are keywords that are a part of certain data
// types in Javasript. For example, the string data type has a property
// called "length". This value is the length of the string. For example,
// if we put "Hello".length in the console, the result would be 5.
//

// we can preform
// 
// Try getting the length of the word "Javascript"
