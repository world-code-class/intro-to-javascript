// In the last lesson, we learned how to use the assignment operators
// to change values of variables. Now we are going to learn about the
// two shortcut operators: increment and decrement
// 
// In Javascript, "++" is used to increase something by 1
// 
// Coincidentally, "--" is used to decrease something by 1
// 
// Let's try some examples
// 
// Define a variable called increase and set it to 1
// Then, increment the variable increase by 1
// Finally, console.log the variable increase
// Your solution here
// 
// 
// Set a variable called decrease and set it to 5
// Then, using the decrement operator, lower it by 1
// Finally, console.log the variable
// Your solution here
