// Conditionals in Javascript check specific conditions and run according
// to what is happening in the code. These are very useful for programming
// more "real world" scenarios. In this lesson we are going to learn
// about the main conditional statement in Javascript: If/Else
// 
// The main way we check for a conditional is by using an if statement. An if
// stataement will evaluate to either true or false, and, depending on the result,
// we can write code to handle these. Let's go through an example:

/*

var passed = true
if(passed) {
	console.log("You passed!")
}

*/

// The code above sets the variable passed to true, then we have the if
// statement. The way to read this is "If passed is equal to true, then do this"
// 
// Now let's try writing our own if statement
// Define a variable called failed and set it to true, then
// write an if statement that checks to see if failed is true. If it
// is, then console.log "You failed!"
// Your solution here:
// 
// 
// If statements are great, but to really use them effectively, we can use
// them with else stataements.
// 
// Adding an else to your if statement turns it into an if/else statement. These
// read "If this is true, do this. Else, do this". They are written like this:
// 

/*

if(condition) {
	do this
} else {
	do this instead
}

*/

// Now let's try writing one
// Write an if/else statement that defines a variable passed, and set it to 
// either true or false. Then, write an if/else statement that checks the value
// of the variable passed. If passed is true, console log "You passed!". Else, console
// log "You failed!"
// Your solution here
