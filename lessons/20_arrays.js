// Arrays can be thought of as storage containers
// They are a list of data of whatever type you pass in
// 
// An array is denoted by using square brackets: []
// 
// To define an array, we add each item to it, separated by a comma
// 
// For example:
// 

var fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Peach"]

// The variable fruits is now an array with 3 strings in it.
// 
// Try creating a variable called scores with the following five
// numbers: 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50
// 
// Your code here:
// 
// 
// Now if we want to access the data in the array, we have to use something
// called an index. The index of an array is what spot in the list we want
// to access. The key with arrays is to remember that indexes start at 0, so
// if we wanted the first element of the fruits array, we would write 
// the following:
// 
// fruits[0] // "Apple"
// fruits[1] // "Orange"
// 
// Now try using console.log to log out the word "Peach"
// 
// Your code here:
// 
// 
// There are some methods on arrays that we will now cover: push, pop, splice,
// and length

// The push method will add an element to the end of the array

// The pop method will remove the last element of an array

// The splice method takes two arguments, the index of where to start, and how
// many spaces we want to go, and will remove those items from an array
// 
// And finally, length will give us the number of items in an array

// Try adding an element to the fruits array, then removing it with pop,
// then using console.log to get the length of the array
// 
// Your code here:
