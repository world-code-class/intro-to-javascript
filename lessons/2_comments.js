// Comments are human-readable lines of text that explain what
// the code is doing. These are useful when working with teams
// of developers on a project
// 
// Comments are not read by the computer, so any code that is "commented out"
// will not run

// In JavaScript, there are two types of comments: single line and multi-line
// Single-line comments are started with two slashes, like this: //
// 
// Multi-line comments are started with a slash and an asterisk, and are
// ended in the reverse order. For example:
// 
// /* starts the comment block
// */ ends the comment block
// 
// 
// All of the code in between the /* and */ will be commented out
// 
// /*
// 
// console.log(1)
// 
// */

// Try commenting out the following code so only odd numbers are printed
// Then, try commenting out the following code so even numbers are printed
// Finally, use a multi-line comment so that only the number 5 is printed
