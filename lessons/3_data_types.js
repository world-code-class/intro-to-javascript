// Data types are the different types of data that we can work with in Javascript
// There are many different data types that we will be working with
// 
// Numbers: This is any number, including decimals
// Examples include 1, 2.5, and 3.2
// 
// String: A string is a group of characters. Many people refer to strings
// as just text. Strings are defined either by two single quotes - '', or
// two double quotes - "". Either way is fine
// 
// An example of a string would be "Hello!"
// 
// 
// Booleans: Booleans are values that are either true or false. The words
// "true" and "false" are Javascript keywords, which mean "Yes" and "No"
// 
// Null: This data type is the representation of an absence of value
// 
// Undefined: This data type is also a representation of an absence of
// value, but is different than null in the sense that a variable that
// has been declared but unassigned is undefined, while null is the 
// intentional assignment of nothing
// 
// Objects: An object in Javascript is a collection of data. We're going
// to go more in depth with these later
// 
// 
// Alright, let's try using console.log to print some data types!
// 
// Try printing "World Code Class" as a string
// Your solution here
// 
// Now try printing the number 2019
// Your solution here
// 
// Finally, try printing the string "Javascript Rules!"
// Your solution here
