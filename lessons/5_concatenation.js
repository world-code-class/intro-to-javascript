// Now we're going to talk about string concatenation
// Concatenation is just a fancy word for "combining two strings"

// 
// When we combine these strings, the string on the right is added to the
// string on the left

// 
// Try adding the strings "Hello" and "World"
// Your solution here
// 
// Now try adding a space between the two words
// Your solution here
