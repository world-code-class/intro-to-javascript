// The console is shell like interface that displays important messages,
// like errors and statuses, for developers. If we want to view custom 
// messages in the console, then we have to log them out

// In JavaScript, the console keyword is an object we can use

// One method that we will use frequently is the log method. This method will print whatever
// we put in it to the console, so let's try it out!

// First, let's try printing some numbers to the console

// This will print the number 3 to the console
console.log(3)
// This will print the number 5 to the console
console.log(5)

// Try printing your age into the console!
// Your solution goes here!
console.log(25)

// Now let's try printing the year you were born in the console
// Your solution goes here!
console.log(1993)
