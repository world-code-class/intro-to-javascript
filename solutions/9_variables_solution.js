// Now we're going to talk about variables
// Variables in javascript are placeholders for values
// Variables can contain any data type
// 
// For example, we can have a variable called myName and set it to "Michael"
// To define a variable, we use the keyword var
// Now let's defne the variable above

// var myName = "Michael"

// Remember, variables can have any data type, so now let's try setting
// an age. 

// var age = 25

// Now it's your turn
// Define a variable called name and set it to your name
var name = "Michael"

// Define another variable called age and set it to your age
var age = 25

// Finally, using console.log and concatenation, print out a message
// that says your name, followed by "is", then your age. For example,
// the two variables above would be "Michael is 25"

console.log(name + " is " + age)
